# Description

  This is a module for Garry's Mod server owners and developers to get the servers FrameCount and RealFrameTime. Somebody mentioned this wasn't recompiled for x86_64, so I set everything up for them to do that if they wanted to. might be some issues with the sourcesdk-minimal, but I suppose people can default to normal sourcesdk if that happens.

# Functions Available

  engine.FrameCount() -- Serverside
  engine.RealFrameTime() -- Serverside


# Compiling

  Compiles are preconfigured to allow you to compile for Linux, Windows and MacOSX. You also have support for x86_64 compiling aswell. You will still need to install sourcesdk-minimal(or sourcesdk2013 if you have issues).


# Credits

  This module was Updated for you by the Vaas Dev Team and Rapadant Hosting.
